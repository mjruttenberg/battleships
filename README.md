# Battleships

A simple Python game based on the Python 2.7 course on Codecademy.

1. Create a 5x5 board
2. Create a battleship on an x and y axis
3. Get the user input and determine if it was a hit/miss/out of range. Loop again if no ship was hit. Inform user if they are out of moves.

TODO:
* Check that user entered an integer
